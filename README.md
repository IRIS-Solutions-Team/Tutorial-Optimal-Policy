## IRIS Tutorial: Optimal Policy

In this tutorial, we describe how to create two types of optimal policy
model specifications based on a loss function, discretion and commitment,
and run various types of experiments with models based on them. The
experiments include simulating shocks, simulation disinflation, and
drawing policy frontiers to describe policy trade-offs.
