% IRIS Tutorial: Optimal Policy Models
%
% In this tutorial, we describe how to create two types of optimal policy
% model specifications based on a loss function, discretion and commitment,
% and run various types of experiments with models based on them. The
% experiments include simulating shocks, simulation disinflation, and
% drawing policy frontiers to describe policy trade-offs.
%
%
% All Matlab programs and model files in this tutorial are also available
% as html files.
%
%
% __Model Files__
%
% Model files can be opened and edited in the Matlab editor (or any other
% plain text editor), but are not run themselves. They are read from
% within Matlab programs (m-files).

 Programs__
%
% Open and run the m-files in the following order:
%
%   read_models                   - Read and Solve Models with Optimal Policy
%   simulate_shocks               - Simulate Simple Shocks with Optimal Policy Models
%   simulate_disinflation         - Simulate Disinflation in Optimal Policy Models
%   draw_policy_frontier          - Draw Policy Frontier
